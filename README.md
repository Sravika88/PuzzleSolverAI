# Puzzle Solver AI

## Project Overview
This project implements search algorithms (BFS, DFS, and A*) to solve the 8-puzzle problem. It includes a custom heuristic designed to improve the efficiency and optimality of the A* algorithm.

## Objectives
- Solve the 8-puzzle problem using:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **A* Search with a custom heuristic**
- Compare the performance of these algorithms based on:
  - Execution Time
  - Nodes Expanded
  - Solution Path Optimality

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sravika88/PuzzleSolverAI.git
